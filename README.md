[![GitHub tag (Latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/ebullient/obsidian-task-collector)](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-task-collector/releases) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ebullient/obsidian-task-collector/total?color=success)

Yet another plugin to manage completed tasks. ;)

## How to install

1. Go to **Community Plugins** in your [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) settings and **disable** Safe Mode
2. Click on **Browse** and search for "task collector"
3. Click install
4. "Enable" the plugin directly after installation, or use the toggle on the community plugins tab to enable the plugin after it has been installed.

## Commands

- **Complete Task**  

    1. If the current line is a task, and it matches the configuration for an incomplete task (where values other than ` ` are valid), it will mark the item as complete (`[x]`). 
    2. Optional: Remove characters matching a configured regular expression from the task, e.g. remove a #task or #todo tag.
    3. Optional: Append a formatted date string to the task

- **Cancel Task** (if enabled)

    1. If the current line is a task, and it matches the configuration for an incomplete task (where values other than ` ` are valid), it will mark the item as canceled (`[-]`). 
    2. Optional: Remove characters matching a configured regular expression from the task, e.g. remove a `#task` or `#todo` tag.
    3. Optional: Append a formatted date string to the task

-  **Reset Task** (as of 0.5.0)

    1. If the current line is a task, and it matches the configuration for a completed task (`[x]` or `[-]` if support for canceled tasks is enabled), it will reset it (`[ ]`). 
    2. If an append date format string is configured, appended text that matches the configured format will be removed.

- **Move completed tasks to configured heading**

    For the current document (open, in edit mode), move any completed (or canceled) tasks into the specified section. It will insert the items after the header (most recent at the top). The section heading will be created if it isn't present, and will stop at the next heading or `---` separator.
    
- **Complete all tasks** (as of 0.4.0)

    For the current document (open, in edit mode), apply the **Complete item** command to all tasks matching the configuration for an incomplete task as complete (`[x]`). 

-  **Reset all completed tasks** (as of 0.4.0)

    For the current document (open, in edit mode), find each completed item that is not in the completed area, and mark it as incomplete (`[ ]`). If an append date format string is configured, appended text that matches the configured format will be removed.

## Settings

- Toggle **Support canceled tasks**  
  Use a `[-]` to indicate a canceled tasks. Canceled tasks are processed in the same way as completed tasks using options below.
  - default: disabled

### Completing tasks

- **Append date to completed task**
    - default: (empty string, disabled)
    - example: `[(]YYYY-MM-DD[)]`, results in `(2021-09-27)`
    - When a [moment.js date format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) is specified, the current date/time will be appended to the task text.
    - *Note:* Use square brackets to surround content that is not part of the format string. When working with dataview-friendly annotations, for example, your format string should look somethng like this: `[[completion::]YYYY-MM-DD[]]`.

- **Remove text in completed (or canceled) task**  
    Remove text matching this [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) from the task text. 
    - default: (empty string, disabled)
    - example: `#(task|todo)` (remove #task or #todo tags)
    - The global flag, 'g' is applied to a per-line match.
    - *Be careful!* Test your expression before using it. There are several [online](https://www.regextester.com/) [tools](https://regex.observepoint.com/) that can help.

- **Incomplete task indicators**  
    Specify the set of characters that indicate incomplete tasks.
    - default: ` ` (space)
    - example: `> ?!` (a space is included along with other values)
    - The "Complete task" and "Cancel task" commands are careful to work only with incomplete tasks. This setting allows checkboxes with other single character values to be treated as incomplete tasks. This is often used for bujo style tasks, e.g. `[>]` for deferred items or `[/]` for items in progress.

### Moving completed tasks to a sub-section

- **Completed area header**  
    Completed (or canceled) items will be inserted under the specified header (most recent at the top).
    - default: `## Log`
    - Notes:
      - The default value will be used if the command is invoked and the configured value is empty. 
      - The heading will be created at the end of the document if it does not exist.
      - When scanning the document for completed (or canceled) tasks, the contents from this configured header to the next heading or separator (`---`) will be ignored.
      - Completed (or canceled) tasks will be moved along with their sub items (nested lists, text, or quotes). 
      - If a completed item has an incomplete child task, the child (and any text following) will remain in the original location.

- **Remove the checkbox from moved items** (âœ¨ 0.6.3)
    Remove the checkbox from completed (or canceled) tasks during the move to the completed area. This transforms tasks into normal list items. Task Collector will not be able to reset these items. They also will not appear in task searches or queries.
    - default: `false`
    
## Right-click editor menu items (Breaking: 0.6.4)

- **Toggle: Add menu item for marking a task** (âœ¨ 0.6.4)
  Add an item to the right-click menu in edit mode to mark the task _on the current line (or within the current selection)_. 
  
  This menu item will trigger a quick pop-up modal to select the desired mark value. You can select an value using a mouse or the keyboard. The selected value will determine follow-on actions: complete, cancel, or reset.

    - default: `false`
    - Notes:
        - Task Collector will use `x` or `X` to complete an item, and `-` to cancel an item (if that support has been enabled). It will use a space (` `) to reset the task, in addition to any of the characters configured as incomplete task indicators.
        - If you enter an unknown value with the keyboard, nothing will happen. 

- **Toggle: Add menu item for completing a task**  
  Add an item to the right-click menu in edit mode to mark the task _on the current line (or within the current selection)_ complete. If canceled items are supported, an additional menu item will be added to mark selected tasks as canceled.
    - default: `false`

- **Toggle: Add menu item for resetting a task** (ðŸ’¥ 0.6.4)
  Add an item to the right-click menu in edit mode to reset the task _on the current line (or within the current selection)_.
    - default: `false`

- **Toggle: Add menu item for completing all tasks** (ðŸ’¥ 0.6.4)
  Add an item to the right-click menu in edit mode to mark _all_ incomplete tasks in the current document complete.  If canceled items are supported, an additional menu item will be added to mark selected tasks as canceled.
    - default: `false`

- **Toggle: Add menu item for resetting all tasks** (ðŸ’¥ 0.6.4)
  Add an item to the right-click menu to reset _all_ completed (or canceled) tasks.
    - default: `false`

- **Toggle: Add menu item for moving all completed tasks**  
  Add an item to the right-click menu to move _all_ completed (or canceled) tasks.
    - default: `false`
